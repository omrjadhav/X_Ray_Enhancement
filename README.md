🔬 Use Case: Doctors often analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound images on digital screens.

✨ How It Helps:
✅ this code already enhances image intensity.
🧐 This can help highlight fine details in medical images, making abnormalities (e.g., tumors, fractures, infections) more visible.
🎛️ Could be extended with additional contrast enhancement or edge detection to improve clarity.
